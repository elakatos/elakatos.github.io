Cell-free DNA sequencing from blood samples is revolutionising many areas of medicine, from cancer detection to transplant monitoring. These applications require ultra-sensitive detection, so molecular barcoding using unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) has become the standard method for cell-free DNA sequencing. In this method, each DNA molecule is tagged with a UMI, so that following amplification and sequencing, read-outs with the same UMI can be collapsed to (i) correct for sequencing errors and (ii) accurately count the number of original DNA molecules. However, since these techniques are still new, there are no established best practices on how to optimise UMI-based sequencing to get maximal read-out. 


I work on stochastic models to simulate the UMI-based sequencing protocol and estimate  
(i) the UMI family size distribution   
(ii) the distribution of mutated reads given a certain cancer proportion and cancer cell fraction in the liquid biopsy.

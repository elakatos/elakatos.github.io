I am a computational biologist, interested in applying mathematical and bioinformatic techniques to understand biology in health and disease. I work at the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Chalmers University of Technology, where I lead the **Computing Disease Evolution in Cancer** (CODEc) group. Our group designs mathematical models and bioinformatic methods to decode how cancers evolve in response to the immune system and treatment.

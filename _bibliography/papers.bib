	abstract = {Locally advanced oesophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) remains difficult to treat because of common resistance to neoadjuvant therapy and high recurrence rates. The ecological and evolutionary dynamics responsible for treatment failure are incompletely understood. Here, we performed a comprehensive multi-omic analysis of samples collected from EAC patients in the MEMORI clinical trial, revealing major changes in gene expression profiles and immune microenvironment composition that did not appear to be driven by changes in clonal composition. Multi-region multi-timepoint whole exome (300x depth) and paired transcriptome sequencing was performed on 27 patients pre-, during and after neoadjuvant treatment. EAC showed major transcriptomic changes during treatment with upregulation of immune and stromal pathways and oncogenic pathways such as KRAS, Hedgehog and WNT. However, genetic data revealed that clonal sweeps were rare, suggesting that gene expression changes were not clonally driven. Additional longitudinal image mass cytometry was performed in a subset of 15 patients and T-cell receptor sequencing in 10 patients, revealing remodelling of the T-cell compartment during treatment and other shifts in microenvironment composition. The presence of immune escape mechanisms and a lack of clonal T-cell expansions were linked to poor clinical treatment response. This study identifies profound transcriptional changes during treatment with limited evidence that clonal replacement is the cause, suggesting phenotypic plasticity and immune dynamics as mechanisms for therapy resistance with pharmacological relevance.},

	abstract = {To characterise the somatic alterations in colorectal cancer (CRC), we conducted whole-genome sequencing analysis of 2,023 tumours. We provide the most detailed high-resolution map to date of somatic mutations in CRC, and demonstrate associations with clinicopathological features, in particular location in the large bowel. We refined the mutational processes and signatures acting in colorectal tumorigenesis. In analyses across the sample set or restricted to molecular subtypes, we identified 185 CRC driver genes, of which 117 were previously unreported. New drivers acted in various molecular pathways, including Wnt (CTNND1, AXIN1, TCF3), TGF-β/BMP (TGFBR1) and MAP kinase (RASGRF1, RASA1, RAF1, and several MAP2K and MAP3K loci). Non-coding drivers included intronic neo-splice site alterations in APC and SMAD4. Whilst there was evidence of an excess of mutations in functionally active regions of the non-coding genome, no specific drivers were called with high confidence. Novel recurrent copy number changes included deletions of PIK3R1 and PWRN1, as well as amplification of CCND3 and NEDD9. Putative driver structural variants included BRD4 and SOX9 regulatory elements, and ACVR2A and ANKRD11 hotspot deletions. The frequencies of many driver mutations, including somatic Wnt and Ras pathway variants, showed a gradient along the colorectum. The Pks-pathogenic E. coli signature and TP53 mutations were primarily associated with rectal cancer. A set of unreported immune escape driver genes was found, primarily in hypermutated CRCs, most of which showed evidence of genetic evasion of the anti-cancer immune response. About 25\% of cancers had a potentially actionable mutation for a known therapy. Thirty-three of the new driver genes were predicted to be essential, 17 possessed a druggable structure, and nine had a bioactive compound available. Our findings provide further insight into the genetics and biology of CRC, especially tumour subtypes defined by genomic instability or clinicopathological features.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Mutation rate optimisation drives evolution and immune evasion of bacteria and lentiviral strains, including HIV. Whether evolving cancer lineages similarly adapt mutation rates to increase tumour cell fitness is unknown. Here, by mapping the clonal topography of mismatch repair-deficient (MMRd) colorectal cancer, we show that genomic MMRd mutability co-evolves with neoantigen selection to drive intratumour diversification and immune escape. Mechanistically, we find that microsatellite instability modulates subclonal DNA repair by toggling two hypermutable mononucleotide homopolymer runs in the mismatch repair genes MSH6 and MSH3 (C8 and A8, respectively) through stochastic frameshift switching. Spontaneous mutation and reversion at these evolvability switches modulates subclonal mutation rate, mutation bias, and clonal HLA diversity during MMRd cancer evolution. Combined experimental and simulation studies demonstrate that subclonal immune selection favours incremental MMR mutations. MMRd cancers thus fuel intratumour heterogeneity by adapting subclonal mutation rate and mutation bias to immune selection, revealing a conserved co-evolutionary arms race between neoantigen selection and adaptive genomic mutability. Our work reveals layers of mutational complexity and microsatellite biology in MMRd cancer evolution previously hidden in bulk analyses.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Drug resistance results in poor outcomes for most patients with metastatic cancer. Adaptive Therapy (AT) proposes to address this by exploiting presumed fitness costs incurred by drug-resistant cells when drug is absent, and prescribing dose reductions to allow fitter, sensitive cells to re-grow and re- sensitise the tumour. However, empirical evidence for treatment-induced fitness change is lacking. We show that fitness costs in chemotherapy-resistant ovarian cancer cause selective decline and apoptosis of resistant populations in low-resource conditions. Moreover, carboplatin AT caused fluctuations in sensitive/resistant tumour population size in vitro and significantly extended survival of tumour-bearing mice. In sequential blood-derived cell-free DNA and tumour samples obtained longitudinally from ovarian cancer patients during treatment, we inferred resistant cancer cell population size through therapy and observed it correlated strongly with disease burden. These data have enabled us to launch a multicentre, phase 2 randomised controlled trial (ACTOv) to evaluate AT in ovarian cancer.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

@article{Househam:2022aa,
	abstract = {Genetic and epigenetic variation, together with transcriptional plasticity, contribute to intratumour heterogeneity1. The interplay of these biological processes and their respective contributions to tumour evolution remain unknown. Here we show that intratumour genetic ancestry only infrequently affects gene expression traits and subclonal evolution in colorectal cancer (CRC). Using spatially resolved paired whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing, we find that the majority of intratumour variation in gene expression is not strongly heritable but rather `plastic'. Somatic expression quantitative trait loci analysis identified a number of putative genetic controls of expression by cis-acting coding and non-coding mutations, the majority of which were clonal within a tumour, alongside frequent structural alterations. Consistently, computational inference on the spatial patterning of tumour phylogenies finds that a considerable proportion of CRCs did not show evidence of subclonal selection, with only a subset of putative genetic drivers associated with subclone expansions. Spatial intermixing of clones is common, with some tumours growing exponentially and others only at the periphery. Together, our data suggest that most genetic intratumour variation in CRC has no major phenotypic consequence and that transcriptional plasticity is, instead, widespread within a tumour.},

	abstract = {Colorectal malignancies are a leading cause of cancer-related death1 and have undergone extensive genomic study2,3. However, DNA mutations alone do not fully explain malignant transformation4--7. Here we investigate the co-evolution of the genome and epigenome of colorectal tumours at single-clone resolution using spatial multi-omic profiling of individual glands. We collected 1,370 samples from 30 primary cancers and 8 concomitant adenomas and generated 1,207 chromatin accessibility profiles, 527 whole genomes and 297 whole transcriptomes. We found positive selection for DNA mutations in chromatin modifier genes and recurrent somatic chromatin accessibility alterations, including in regulatory regions of cancer driver genes that were otherwise devoid of genetic mutations. Genome-wide alterations in accessibility for transcription factor binding involved CTCF, downregulation of interferon and increased accessibility for SOX and HOX transcription factor families, suggesting the involvement of developmental genes during tumourigenesis. Somatic chromatin accessibility alterations were heritable and distinguished adenomas from cancers. Mutational signature analysis showed that the epigenome in turn influences the accumulation of DNA mutations. This study provides a map of genetic and epigenetic tumour heterogeneity, with fundamental implications for understanding colorectal cancer biology.},

Here we analyzed >10,000 primary tumors and 356 immune-checkpoint-treated metastases using immune dN/dS, the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutations in the immunopeptidome, to measure immune selection in cohorts and individuals. We classified tumors as immune edited when antigenic mutations were removed by negative selection and immune escaped when antigenicity was covered up by aberrant immune modulation. Only in immune-edited tumors was immune predation linked to CD8 T cell infiltration. Immune-escaped metastases experienced the best response to immunotherapy, whereas immune-edited patients did not benefit, suggesting a preexisting resistance mechanism. Similarly, in a longitudinal cohort, nivolumab treatment removes neoantigens exclusively in the immunopeptidome of nonimmune-edited patients, the group with the best overall survival response. Our work uses dN/dS to differentiate between immune-edited and immune-escaped tumors, measuring potential antigenicity and ultimately helping predict response to treatment.},

We demonstrate the accuracy of liquidCNA in synthetically generated sample sets and in vitro mixtures of cancer cell lines.

	abstract = {Clinical archives of patient material near-exclusively consist of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks. The ability to precisely characterise mutational signatures from FFPE-derived DNA has tremendous translational potential. However, sequencing of DNA derived from FFPE material is known to be riddled with artefacts. Here we derive genome-wide mutational signatures caused by formalin fixation. We show that the FFPE-signature is highly similar to signature 30 (the signature of Base Excision Repair deficiency due to NTHL1 mutations), and chemical repair of DNA lesions leads to a signature highly similar to signature 1 (clock-like signature due to spontaneous deamination of methylcytosine). We demonstrate that using uncorrected mutational catalogues of FFPE samples leads to major mis-assignment of signature activities. To correct for this, we introduce FFPEsig, a computational algorithm to rectify the formalin-induced artefacts in the mutational catalogue. We demonstrate that FFPEsig enables accurate mutational signature analysis both in simulated and whole-genome sequenced FFPE cancer samples. FFPEsig thus provides an opportunity to unlock additional clinical potential of archival patient tissues.},

We identify endogenous fluctuating CpG (fCpG) sites using standard methylation arrays and develop a mathematical model to quantitatively measure human adult stem cell dynamics from these data. Small intestinal crypts were inferred to contain slightly more stem cells than the colon, with slower stem cell replacement in the small intestine. Germline APC mutation increased the number of replacements per crypt. In blood, we measured rapid expansion of acute leukemia and slower growth of chronic disease. Thus, the patterns of human somatic cell birth and death are measurable with fluctuating methylation clocks (FMCs).},

@article{Hockings:2019aa,
	abstract = {Background Survival in high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is impacted by the emergence of resistance to platinum chemotherapy. The traditional ethos of killing the greatest number of cancer cells with the maximum tolerated dose of chemotherapy may be flawed in evolutionary terms, facilitating the growth of resistant subclones and accelerating decreased treatment efficacy. Adaptive therapy is a new model of cancer treatment that exploits the competitive interactions between drug-sensitive and resistant subclones. The aim is to maintain a stable tumour burden by keeping a sufficient population of sensitive cells which suppress the proliferation of the `less fit' resistant cells. A challenge in bringing adaptive therapy to the clinical setting is quantifying the relative proportions of sensitive and resistant disease to guide the personalised scheduling of treatment. In HGSOC, chemotherapy resistance is not associated with any common, measurable point mutations, but is correlated with a higher burden of copy number aberrations. We have utilised this to develop a method of quantifying the relative proportion of chemotherapy resistant disease. Methods An in silico dilution series was created using known copy number profiles of paired sensitive and resistant HGSOC OVCAR4 cells. Low pass whole genome sequencing (1×) was performed on cell mixtures of known ratios and bioinformatician-blinded ratios, combined with varied amounts of `normal' DNA extracted from donor leucocytes. Results Our proof of principle experiment verified the method of quantifying copy number aberrations as a biomarker of the resistant population. The technique is now being applied to circulating tumour DNA isolated from serial plasma samples collected from 10 HGSOC patients, using the copy number profile from a diagnostic biopsy as a baseline for sensitive disease. Conclusions We have developed a method to monitor the relative drug-sensitive/resistant composition of tumours that can be applied to liquid biopsies. This will enable real-time serial tracking of tumour composition allowing for tumour heterogeneity, and guide personalised treatment scheduling in adaptive therapy.

	abstract = {Introduction The immune system plays an active role in fighting growing tumours via recognising tumour-specific neoantigens and initiating an immune response. Consequently, the abundance and diversity of tumour neoantigens is shaped by the interaction with immune cells. Colonic mucosa in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has a high immune cell presence, and we hypothesised this would cause increased immune predation on neoantigen-bearing epithelial cells. To test this, we compared neoantigen burdens in ulcerative colitis-associated colorectal cancers (CA-CRCs) and sporadically arising colorectal cancers (SPCRCs).Methods Existing multi-region whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing data1 2 from CA-CRCs (n=15) and SPCRCs (n=10) was used to computationally predict the abundance and diversity of immunogenic neoantigens using NeoPredPipe.3 Variant call data was filtered to retain high confidence variants. Neoantigen burden was compared between groups using a normalised measure, representing the proportion of non-synonymous mutations predicted to produce >=1 immunogenic neoantigen. Multi-region data from normal, histologically normal adjacent-to-tumour (NAT) and tumour samples was used to calculate the clonality and subclonality of neoantigens.Results The neoantigen burden of CA-CRCs was lower than SPCRCs (figure 1). Excluding cancers with microsatellite instability, CA-CRCs had relatively higher numbers of subclonal neoantigens per clonal neoantigens (p=0.029, Wilcoxon test), suggesting a greater degree of intra-tumour heterogeneity in CA-CRCs. In a subset of patients with CA-CRCs, 50{\textendash}100\% of clonal neoantigens found in tumour samples were shared with NAT samples in the same patient, revealing evidence of field cancerisation at the neoantigen level.Abstract O15 Figure 1 Comparison of neoantigen burden between CA-CRCs and SPCRCsConclusions These novel results support the hypothesis of increased immune surveillance in CA-CRCs compared to SPCRCs. Subclonal neoantigens accrue following immune escape, and so the higher burden of subclonal neoantigens in CA-CRCs points to the early evolution of effective immune escape mechanisms in these tumours. These data have implications for prognostication and immunotherapy treatment decisions for patients with CA-CRCs.ReferencesBaker AM, et al.

We developed a computational framework to identify dominant mechanisms controlling the variation of protein abundance in a simple model of gene expression from the summary statistics of single cell steady state protein expression distributions. Our results, based on single cell data analysed in a Bayesian framework, lends strong support to a model in which variation in the basal p53 protein abundance may be best explained by variations in the rate of p53 protein degradation. This is supported by measurements of the relative average levels of mRNA which are very similar despite large variation in the level of protein.},

	abstract = {Models describing the process of stem-cell differentiation are plentiful, and may offer insights into the underlying mechanisms and experimentally observed behaviour. Waddington's epigenetic landscape has been providing a conceptual framework for differentiation processes since its inception. It also allows, however, for detailed mathematical and quantitative analyses, as the landscape can, at least in principle, be related to mathematical models of dynamical systems. Here we focus on a set of dynamical systems features that are intimately linked to cell differentiation, by considering exemplar dynamical models that capture important aspects of stem cell differentiation dynamics. These models allow us to map the paths that cells take through gene expression space as they move from one fate to another, e.g. from a stem-cell to a more specialized cell type. Our analysis highlights the role of the transition state (TS) that separates distinct cell fates, and how the nature of the TS changes as the underlying landscape changes-change that can be induced by e.g. cellular signaling. We demonstrate that models for stem cell differentiation may be interpreted in terms of either a static or transitory landscape. For the static case the TS represents a particular transcriptional profile that all cells approach during differentiation. Alternatively, the TS may refer to the commonly observed period of heterogeneity as cells undergo stochastic transitions.},

	abstract = {Titin is a giant protein spanning between the Z- and M-lines of the sarcomere. In the A-band titin is associated with the myosin thick filament. It has been speculated that titin may serve as a blueprint for thick-filament formation due to the super-repeat structure of its A-band domains. Accordingly, titin might provide a template that determines the length and structural periodicity of the thick filament. Here we tested the titin ruler hypothesis by mixing titin and myosin at in situ stoichiometric ratios (300 myosins per 12 titins) in buffers of different ionic strength (KCl concentration range 100--300 mM). The topology of the filamentous complexes was investigated with atomic force microscopy. We found that the samples contained distinct, segregated populations of titin molecules and myosin thick filaments. We were unable to identify complexes in which myosin molecules were regularly associated to either mono- or oligomeric titin in either relaxed or stretched states of the titin filaments. Thus, the electrostatically driven self-association is stronger in both myosin and titin than their binding to each other, and it is unlikely that titin functions as a geometrical template for thick-filament formation. However, when allowed to equilibrate configurationally, long myosin thick filaments appeared with titin oligomers attached to their surface. The titin meshwork formed on the thick-filament surface may play a role in controlling thick-filament length by regulating the structural dynamics of myosin molecules and placing a mechanical limit on the filament length.},

The model predicts that, without immune escape, tumor neoantigens are either clonal or at low frequency; hypermutated tumors can only establish after the evolution of immune escape. Moreover, the site frequency spectrum of somatic variants under negative selection appears more neutral as the strength of negative selection increases, which is consistent with classical neutral theory.

We show that our reachability analysis formalism can describe the potential behaviour of biological (naturally evolved as well as engineered) systems, and provides a set of bounds on their dynamics at the level of population statistics: for example, we can obtain the possible ranges of means and variances of mRNA and protein expression levels, even in the presence of uncertainty about model parameters. },
